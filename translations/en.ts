We are not liable for the content of the recordings. We point out that on the server Youtuber / Streamer play and your voices may be heard on Youtube / Twitch. To ensure moderation, only English or German is allowed in the global chat. In case of violations we will mute the perpetrators.',

Spam in our social media groups (Discord, Steam, Facebook, etc.) that have nothing to do with Rust or our server will be deleted without discussion. Links to any cheats or hacks in our social media groups will result in a ban.',

Every admin has a number behind his name in Discord (see #server-bans) and should write this also with a ban.
