## Ideas

- [ ] Show if player is in the rise or on the fall indicated with a red/green arrow in stats table and user plage.
- [x] Show top player of the day instead of random player in spotlight on the stats page. Maybe indicated with a flame.
- [ ] Send state from Py Script to this page via Webhook and then save in firebase. For example last Player Update SUCCESS/ERROR or Can not Update Player data. Also show the state from the user table to the user (Update / updating and show last update)
- [ ] Calendar that shows wipes. Automatically show forced Wipes and option to add custom wipes in Dashboard
- [x] Show related profiles on user profile page (Social Media like) and show friends on server
- [ ] Show highest kill streak.
- [ ] show overall rust stats. If not public show demo graphs blurred like vercel
- [x] Add image to discord announce. Default grab first url from text.
- [ ] show player log with nice design like github ink name changes, kills, deaths, pve deaths.
- [ ] Calculate skill value or level for player based of stats
- [ ] Option to ban player from comments
- [x] Option to report comment
- [ ] Add watch player option. If some one watches a player he always sees him on the main page (or some where else)
- [X] Add something to the header like the current players "We have **13000+** active players"
- [ ] Show last wipe in the header. Small or large Badge stamp if it hast just wiped 1-2 days ago.
- [x] Different roles. Admin/Moderator with different access levels (Important for VIP)
- [ ] VIP shop
- [ ] Map voting

- [ ] Compare player with average (leetify)
- [ ] Mark banned players
- [ ] PVE Grafik reduzieren
- [ ] Allow to starr players
- [ ] Link to steam
- [ ] Allow to set notes for player

## Questions

- Force steam sign in? / no
- Convert names of pve deaths back do ids on don't convert new ones in python script? Format in frontend instead. maybe display additional info (Frontend logic implementation is done) / yes
- Combat log public / yes, but limite number of entries and only show names to logged in users
- Stripe with a lot of payment methods but paypal or just paypal / paypal
