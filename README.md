## Maintenance

### Domain change

If the domain is changed it must also be changed in the CONSTANTS file. Some functionality may be dependent on this setting.

## Setup

### Secrets

The following secrets must be set as environment variables.

- **PROJECT_ID**: firebase-admin project id
- **CLIENT_EMAIL**: firebase-admin client id
- **PRIVATE_KEY**: firebase admin private key
- **STEAM_API_KEY**: Steam API key
- **SESSION_KEY**: Random secret with a min length of 32 for [iron session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session)
- **DATABASE_URL**: Database URL for Prisma
- **DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL**: Webhook URL from discord

### Database

[Add full text search](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/activating-full-text-searching.aspx)

```mysql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX text_search ON players(name)
```

## Ideas

- [ ] Show if player is in the rise or on the fall indicated with a red/green arrow in stats table and user plage.
- [ ] Show top player of the day instead of random player in spotlight on the stats page. Maybe indicated with a flame.
- [ ] Send state from Py Script to this page via Webhook and then save in firebase. For example last Player Update SUCCESS/ERROR or Can not Update Player data. Also show the state from the user table to the user (Uptodate / updating and show last update)
- [ ] Calendar that shows wipes. Automatically show forced Wipes and option to add custom wipes in Dashboard
- [x] Show related profiles on user profile page (Social Media like) and show friends on server
- [ ] Show highest kill streak.
